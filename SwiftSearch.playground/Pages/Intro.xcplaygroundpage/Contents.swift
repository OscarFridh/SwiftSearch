 # Swift Search

 In this Playground we will explore a couple of search algorithms step by step in a playful and educational way.
 
 ## UX
 - Input: Swift code
 - Output: Animations illustrating the algorithms
 
 The animations are directly tied to your code, meaning that any modifications are reflected visually!
